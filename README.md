# Problems?
## **1. "wait 10 seconds to load text"**
If you encounter the prompt window "wait 10 seconds to load text," please don't worry.   
<br>
This is because ChatGPT's data backend is transferring data, and we can only download the text after the data transfer is complete.  
<br>
We don't actually need to wait for the full 10 seconds; usually, try again after <code>3-4 seconds</code> and everything solved.  
<br>
Please note that buttons only supports single-page data. If you try to use them on the homepage, it will continue to show a warning, and you need to switch to a chat page with content.

## **2. Cannot see content after "mem it" successfully?**
That's an issue of memdotai, usually it would take 1-2 seconds to load the content to your account. Sometimes it needs more time, just refresh your mem client after 3-4 seconds and be patient.
